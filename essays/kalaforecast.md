### I. Introduction
This semester I was able to take a course called ICS 414: Software Engineering II. This course varied differently to other computer science courses at Manoa because it is a team project based course. I found that it was the closest I've ever had to real world experience in the field. We had to learn to assign tasks to one another, set aside realistic goals, and have group meetings every so often to check everyone's progress and issues. Compared to other courses it was surprisingly difficult to adapt from independent work to team work. There's a lot more checks that code must go through including approval for commits and pushes to main (which are always fear inducing). Overall there was a lot I learned from the group aspect of this course. 

### II. The Goal
At the beginning of the year we were all assigned to a small group. We were provided with a spreadsheet featuring the data and math functions that would need to be accessible in the application. The program would feature role based accessibility, as in only auditors can modify audit data, analysts can perform calculations, administrators can modify user accounts, etc. We'd also need to implement a database that can hold user and finance information. Finally, being able to deploy it with in our case Digital Ocean. Truthfully it seemed pretty daunting at the start of the class. This would be the largest scale project that I'd ever worked on. There was an initial meeting with Spire (the customer) to discuss the primary functions of the application, what they were looking for as users, and provided a space that we could ask questions. Our goal was to work together to program a financial forecast application and model for a finance organization called Spire.

### III. The Process
After we initally met with our team for the first time, we had our first Customer Milestone Meeting. These meetings serve as checkups between the programmer and the customer to check progress and ask questions. It felt very practical and professional and is definitely an aspect of work I'd expect in the field. During these meetings we'd take notes and show off our progress. As stated previously, the first meeting was more introductory to who the customer was and what they were looking for in the application. Throughout the project's life we used the Milestone Project feature on Github. After the meetings we'd consult our notes and add tasks to the project board to be completed. This allowed us to set specific goals and deadlines to adhere to. Usually we wanted each person to add around 2-3 tasks per milestone to streamline our productivity and ensure that we're making good progress between milestones. While it was easy to finish the board in the beginning of the semester, towards the end the tasks became more complex and required more time. On top of that other classes started have midterms, exams, and more rigorous work so it became more challenging to balance. Something that I wouldn't expect to be too much of an issue when only working. We implemented our application using a combination of Meteor and React jsx building upon the Island Snow template from ICS 314.
