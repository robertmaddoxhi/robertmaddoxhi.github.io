### I. Introduction
This semester I was able to take a course called ICS 414: Software Engineering II. This course varied differently to other computer science courses at Manoa because it is a team project based course. I found that it was the closest I've ever had to real world experience in the field. We had to learn to assign tasks to one another, set aside realistic goals, and have group meetings every so often to check everyone's progress and issues. Compared to other courses it was surprisingly difficult to adapt from independent work to team work. There's a lot more checks that code must go through including approval for commits and pushes to main (which are always fear inducing). Overall there was a lot I learned from the group aspect of this course. 

### II. The Goal
At the beginning of the year we were all assigned to a small group. Our goal was to work together to program a financial forecast application and model for a finance organization. We were provided with a spreadsheet featuring the data and math that would need to be accessible in the application.
